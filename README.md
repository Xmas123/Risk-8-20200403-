## Start a server
You can run several web servers on different ports at once, showing different projects.

The very first time (after downloading) run:

```text
npm install
```

To start a web server write:

```text
npm start name-of-project-folder port-number
```

For example

```text
npm start example-shop 4000
```

or 

```text
npm start documentation 3333
```

(If you omit the port number port 3000 will be used.)
